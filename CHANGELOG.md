# Change Log

## [Unreleased]


## [1.0.0] - 2023-07-19

Changed:
- `RecompositionClock` is now named `RecompositionMode` to better reflect that it is not itself the clock,
  but the mode by which Molecule will perform recomposition. A clock is always used internally as that is the
  underlying mechanism of Compose.
- Darwin frame clock and the internal frame clock used with `RecompositionMode.Immediate` now correctly
  send actual frame times.


## [0.11.0] - 2023-06-30

New:
- Support for Kotlin 1.8.22
- Switch to JetBrains Compose compiler 1.4.8 (AndroidX Compose compiler 1.4.8)


## [0.10.0] - 2023-06-26

New:
- Support for Kotlin 1.8.21
- Update to JetBrains Compose runtime 1.4.1 (AndroidX Compose runtime 1.4.3).
- Switch to JetBrains Compose compiler 1.4.7 (AndroidX Compose compiler 1.4.7)


## [0.9.0] - 2023-04-12

New:
- Support for Kotlin 1.8.20
- Update to JetBrains Compose runtime 1.4.0 (AndroidX Compose runtime 1.4.0).
- Switch to JetBrains Compose compiler 1.4.5 (as yet unreleased AndroidX Compose compiler, probably 1.4.5)


## [0.8.0] - 2023-03-09

New:
- Support for Kotlin 1.8.10
- Update to JetBrains Compose runtime 1.3.1 (AndroidX Compose runtime 1.2.1).
- Switch to JetBrains Compose compiler 1.3.2.1 (AndroidX Compose compiler 1.3.2 + JS fix)


## [0.7.1] - 2023-02-20

New:
- Add `WindowAnimationFrameClock` for use in browser-based JS environments.

Changed:
- Switch to JetBrains Compose compiler which has better support for JS and native targets.


## [0.7.0] - 2023-01-17

New:
- Support for Kotlin 1.8.0
- Switch (back) to AndroidX Compose compiler 1.4.0


## [0.6.1] - 2022-11-16

New:
- Add support for `watchosArm32` and `watchosX86` native targets.


## [0.6.0] - 2022-11-08

New:
- Support for Kotlin 1.7.20
- Update to JetBrains Compose runtime 1.2.1 (AndroidX Compose runtime 1.2.1).
- Switch to JetBrains Compose compiler 1.3.2.1 (AndroidX Compose compiler 1.3.2 + JS fix)

Fixed:
- When applying the Compose compiler plugin to Kotlin/JS targets, ensure decoys are used.
- Add `cacheKind=none` Gradle configuration which ensures downstream Kotlin/Native projects can link.


## [0.5.0] - 2022-10-13

New:

 - Update to JetBrains Compose runtime 1.2.0 (this uses AndroidX Compose runtime 1.2.1).
 - Add iOS, MacOS, tvOS, watchOS, linux, and windows targets for Kotlin/Native.

Changed:

 - The 'molecule-testing' artifact has been removed.


## [0.5.0-beta01] - 2022-09-16

New:

 - Update to JetBrains Compose runtime 1.2.0-beta01 (this uses AndroidX Compose runtime 1.2.1).
 - Add iOS, MacOS, tvOS, watchOS, linux, and windows targets for Kotlin/Native.

Changed:

 - The 'molecule-testing' artifact has been removed.


## [0.4.0] - 2022-08-10

New:

 - Update to Compose compiler 1.3.0 which supports Kotlin 1.7.10.

Fixed:

 - Prevent "Trying to call 'getOrThrow' on a failed channel result: Failed" exceptions when using the immediate recompose clock.


## [0.4.0-beta01] - 2022-07-27

New:

 - Update to Compose compiler 1.3.0-beta01 which supports Kotlin 1.7.10.


## [0.3.1] - 2022-08-10

Fixed:

 - Prevent "Trying to call 'getOrThrow' on a failed channel result: Failed" exceptions when using the immediate recompose clock.


## [0.3.0] - 2022-07-27

New:

 - Enable Kotlin multiplatform usage on JVM and JS targets (in addition to Android). All native targets are blocked on JetBrains' Compose runtime supporting them (with a stable release).
 - Update to Compose compiler 1.2.0 which supports Kotlin 1.7.0.
 - Add `RecomposeClock` parameter to both `moleculeFlow` and `launchMolecule` which allows choosing between a frame-based clock for recomposition or a clock which immediately recomposes for any change.
 - The 'molecule-testing' library is deprecated. The recommendation is to use the new immediate clock mode and [Turbine](https://github.com/cashapp/turbine/). If you have a use case which cannot be handled by this change please comment on [this issue](https://github.com/cashapp/molecule/issues/97).


## [0.2.0] - 2022-02-09

New:

 - Update to Compose 1.1.0 which supports Kotlin 1.6.10

Fixed:

 - Explicitly dispose internal `Composition` allowing `DisposableEffect`s to fire.


## [0.1.0] - 2021-11-10
